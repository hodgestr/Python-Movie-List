# CS223 HW4 - Contact List with Classes - Instructor Dan Eshner
# By Tiffany Hodges on 11/17/2020
# A mix of sources were used to aid me in my code. Each source has been commented
# next to where it was used
# Peer reviews by:
# This is a program that holds a list of contacts with several attributes like name, age, gender, etc.
# The list can be manipulated (adding, editing, and deleting a contact)
# User can also choose to list all contacts to see what is in the list
# When user exits the program, the list will go back to its original form (3 listings)
# This is a beginner's program as this is my first python class, therefore
# the code itself is far from advanced


# used for regular expressions to check the email and phone number

# here are all the constants used throughout my code
